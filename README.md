## üìù Usage

### **Shorten URLs**
- Go to the home page.
- Enter up to 5 long URLs.
- Optionally set validity (in minutes) and/or a custom shortcode.
- Click **Shorten URLs**.
- Get your short links and expiry info instantly.

### **View Statistics**
- Go to the **Statistics** page from the top navigation.
- See all your shortened URLs, their creation/expiry, and click counts.
- Expand any row to see detailed click analytics (timestamp, source, location).

### **Redirection**
- Open any short URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/abc123`) in your browser.
- The app will log the click and redirect to the original URL (if not expired).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Logging Middleware
- All significant actions (shorten, click, errors) are logged using a custom logger (`src/utils/logger.js`).
- No use of `console.log` or browser loggers.
- Logs are stored in localStorage and can be extended/exported if needed.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes
- **No backend**: All data is managed in the browser (localStorage).
- **No authentication**: Anyone can use the app; all users are pre-authorized.
- **Material UI only**: No other CSS frameworks or libraries are used.
- **Client-side routing**: All short URLs and stats are handled by React Router.

## ‚ùì FAQ / Notes
- **Persistence:** All data is stored in your browser. Clearing localStorage will erase all URLs and stats.
- **Geolocation:** Click analytics use mock locations for demo purposes.
- **Extending:** You can add backend support, authentication, or real geolocation as needed.
